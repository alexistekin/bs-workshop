# This dockerfile builds an image for the backend package.
# It should be executed with the root of the repo as docker context.
#
# Before building this image, be sure to have run the following commands in the repo root:
#
# yarn install
# yarn tsc
# yarn build:backend
#
# Once the commands have been run, you can build the image using `yarn build-image`

# This should create the app dir as `node`.
# If it is instead created as `root` then the `tar` command below will fail: `can't create directory 'packages/': Permission denied`.
# If this occurs, then ensure BuildKit is enabled (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`) so the app dir is correctly created as `node`.

# The skeleton contains the package.json of each package in the monorepo,
# and along with yarn.lock and the root package.json, that's enough to run yarn install.
